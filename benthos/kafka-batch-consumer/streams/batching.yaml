# https://v4.benthos.dev/docs/components/inputs/kafka
# The Kafka input allows parallel processing of messages from different topic partitions,
# but by default messages of the same topic partition are processed in lockstep in order to
# enforce ordered processing.
# This protection often means that batching messages at the output level can stall,
# in which case it can be tuned by increasing the field checkpoint_limit,
# ideally to a value greater than the number of messages you expect to batch.
#
# Alternatively, if you perform batching at the input level
# using the batching field it is done per-partition and therefore avoids stalling.
